        <h2> What is computer?</h2>
        <p>Before we understand what program is, you must know what is a computer. A computer is a device that can accept human instruction, processes it and responds to it or a computer is a computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program. Program is a sequence of instruction along with data.
        </p>

        <h2> What are the basic components of computer?</h2>
        <p>The basic components of a computer are:
            <ol>
                <li>Input unit</li>
                <li>CPU</li>
                <li>Output unit</li>
            </ol>
            Most of us have heard that CPU is called the brain of our computer because it accepts data, provides temporary memory space to it until it is stored(saved) on the hard disk, performs logical operations on it and hence processes(here also means converts) data into information. We all know that a computer consists of hardware and software. Software is a set of programs that performs multiple tasks together. An operating system is also a software (system software) that helps humans to interact with the computer system.
        </p>
        

        <h2> What is program? </h2>
        <p>A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation.    or computer is a
            computational device which is used to process the data under the control of a computer program.While
            executing the program, raw data is processed into a desired output format. These computer programs are
            written in a programming language which are high level languages. High level languages are nearly human
            languages which are more complex then the computer understandable language which are called machine
            language, or low level language.So after knowing the basics, we are ready to create a very simple and basic
            program.
